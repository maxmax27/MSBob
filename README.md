# Microsoft Bob's Evolution

**It's not like it used to be, nor does it want to be. What remains is the character and the spirit in this Project.**

Who still remembers Microsoft Bob? Behind it was software designed to make the operating system Windows 3.1 more intuitive and user-friendly. Even then, Microsoft recognized the need for an enhanced user experience, acknowledging the less-than-friendly nature of the existing Windows version.

This inconsistency persists today. While the XP search's little Bob with the dog may no longer be part of the Windows scene, and Comic Sans font (believed to have been designed for Bob) endures, the inconsistent UI still permeates many areas of Windows 11. In a nutshell, Bob wasn't well-received back then, and Windows 11 remains a matter of taste. Personally, I appreciate it, and perhaps, with the revamped MSBob, I can elevate and simplify your experience a bit.

My iteration of MSBob (considered MSBelim, but that might be too obvious ðŸ˜†, or the female versions MSBella or MSRoberta ðŸ˜¸) serves as an add-on for the Windows setup, offering an alternative one-page user interface to make various setup steps accessible (afterward). MSBob accompanies you with witty remarks, always ready with something to say. Although Bob remains somewhat static, local, and "dumb," change is on the horizon. I could also envision the future of AI copilots in applications, for example, in Windows 12. A bit of interaction with the user and targeted assistance, avoiding confusing error messages.

The modern MSBob is fundamentally a hybrid app. Edge Chromium (its not an shared runtime and im bundeling webview2 library within download source) is used as the rendering module, allowing JavaScript, HTML and CSS to be embedded. Therefore, don't be surprised if, during usage, a cache folder is created in the application directory of the app. You can search in MSBob via <Ctrl + F> as in your Edge browser, you can zoom via <CTRL + scroll> as in your Chromium.  The app is built securely and initially focuses on integral Windows 11 installation steps. While it should run on Windows 10, extensive testing on this platform is pending.

**Originally planned for release two weeks ago, Bob now emerges as the first creation of the new year, 2024. To this end, Happy New Year, friends! May Bob bring you much joy and delight!**

**A bob of fun**
If you want to add some extra fun, I've given the UI a makeover for the sake of nostalgia, bringing back the good old vibes. Go ahead, download 'bobkernel_makeover.zip,' (replace the existing one) and give your Bob a touch of this playful transformation.
